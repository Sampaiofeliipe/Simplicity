Author's description:

This purple '''Delta Neon''' cursor set has a pinkish girly touch to it. However, the borders do classify as a purple theme for this cursor set. The '''Delta Neon Purple''' cursor set is great for that girlish look.

; Delta45 cursors created by Hopachi.

This cursor set comes with 19 cursor roles. Two cursors are animated in this set. Please note that not all '''Delta Neon''' cursor sets in this series have animated '''Busy''' and '''Working In Background''' cursor roles. The other cursor roles in this series are always static cursors. There are additional mouse pointer cursors for users who operates the use of a mouse differently. That is left handed or both hands. Most users are right handed like me, '''RIDDLER''', from RealWorld. Enjoy this cool color tone.
